This project is a Java-based web scraping application that collects product information from an e-commerce website. It scans the HTML source, identifies tags like product titles and prices, and extracts only the meaningful details. The output is displayed in a clean and readable format as pairs of Product Name â€“ Price, instead of cluttered HTML code.
