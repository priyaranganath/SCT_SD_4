This project is a basic web scraping application built using Java. Its main purpose is to demonstrate how product-related information can be automatically collected from an e-commerce website. The program scans through the HTML source code of a webpage, identifies specific tags (such as product titles inside <h2> tags and prices inside 
<span class="price"> tags), and extracts only the meaningful details. Instead of showing the raw and cluttered HTML code, it processes the data and presents the output in a clean, readable format as pairs of Product Name â€“ Price.
